# Customize your Vim/Neovim directly with Ruby
>My editor of choice is Neovim. Do you know what advantage Vim/Neovim have for us Rubyists? Yes, we can write plugins with Ruby! This facility made it possible to develop rspec-current.vim, a Vim/Neovim plugin to tell you what subject and context are in your cursor position. It's useful with deeply nested RSpec file. As I mentioned, we can use Ruby as a plugin development language. This means we can even use RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree in our plugin. In this talk I'll talk about the implementation detail of the plugin and encourage you to do the same!

# Ultra-fast test-driven development
>Software testing is crucial in our daily development process. Our team adopts mob programming to develop many features. While we also use TDD for development, it is known that running tests with Rspec can be slow. In particular, loading and initializing files can be a bottleneck.

# Optimizing Ruby’s Memory Layout: Variable Width Allocation
